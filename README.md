# geom99lab2

This is a Practical Lab demostration of the skills which was a learning outcome from the GEOM 99 Web Design course
- The primary outcome from this repo is the arcGIS online (AGOL)
- How to create a Online web map displaying with an API key but the API key wasn't working for me which I have a bug report explains the bug which was reproduced in every map created with the API key.
- I have tired creating multiple API keys and embedding with the map but it throws the same error for which I have added a Image explaing that.
